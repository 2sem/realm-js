Class Model Solution Proposals
We in the javascript team have opposing views on how to move forward with the concerns addressed in:


Assuming we have default from function support

## Goals
Provide sound Typescript support
Should allow a structure to be created before it is committed to the database
For example: Instantiating a list into the model
Allow pushing elements into a list
Provide a clear way of utilizing class models in Realm

## Preliminary Assumptions
We have already developed support for providing property default value through a functional interface
